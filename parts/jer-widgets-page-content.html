To ensure it's the page you want, add underscores (__) in front of the title, though less than the ABOUT page which must come first. You should use an SEO plugin to block the actual page from being indexed, and create a redirect from the page to the homepage (SEO Framework can do this from the page editing screen), as well as obviously ensuring it never gets inserted into menus."} -->
